Currently Health Care is using a manual system to handle the hospital process. When patients arrive they make an appointment at the reception to consult a Doctor.
These are being recorded in a file. As the current system is file based , management of the hospital has to put much effort on securing the files. 
They can be easily damaged by fire, insects and natural disasters. Also they could be misplaced by losing data and information. 

                                                                    Product Functions:
